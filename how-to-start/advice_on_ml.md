# how to learn machine learning

Machine learning can seems daunting, need to organize yourself and learn machine learning step by step.
1. Learning machine learning is really an endless task. so try to first focus on one field (e.g. Named Entity Recognition) and then familiarize with the deep learning library first.

1. When self learning machine learing/deep learning, Systematic learning is really important and making notes as you learning it.
    
1. Taking courses is surely a necessity. but after grasping these concepts, you may want to try several kaggle competition or try to replicate some papers(this is one of the best way to learn according to [Andrew Ng](https://www.quora.com/How-can-beginners-in-machine-learning-who-have-finished-their-MOOCs-in-machine-learning-and-deep-learning-take-it-to-the-next-level-and-get-to-the-point-of-being-able-to-read-research-papers-productively-contribute-in-an-industry)), or doing some projects.

Here is some [machine learning advice](http://blog.kaggle.com/2017/04/17/the-best-sources-to-study-machine-learning-and-ai-with-ben-hamner-kaggle-cto/) by kaggle CTO.

1. pick a project you believe in.
2. run dirty end2end tests.
3. evolve and improve your solution
4. write up and share your solution
5. repeat #1~4 on multiple projects
6. seriously compete in Kaggle
7. apply machine learning proficiently
*8. ways to teach others about machine learning:
    Writing research papers (replicating research papers is also a underappreciated way of learning).
    Giving talks
    Writing blog posts and tutorials
    Answering questions on Kaggle, Quora, and other sites
    In-person mentorship and tutoring
    Sharing code examples (in Kaggle Kernels and on GitHub)
    Teaching a class
    Writing a book
