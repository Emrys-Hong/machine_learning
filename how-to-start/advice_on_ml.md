[machine learning advice by kaggle CTO](http://blog.kaggle.com/2017/04/17/the-best-sources-to-study-machine-learning-and-ai-with-ben-hamner-kaggle-cto/)
```
1. pick a project you believe in.
2. run dirty end2end tests.
3. evolve and improve your solution
4. write up and share your solution
5. repeat #1~4 on multiple projects
6. seriously compete in Kaggle
7. apply machine learning proficiently
*8. ways to teach others about machine learning:
    Writing research papers (replicating research papers is also a underappreciated way of learning).
    Giving talks
    Writing blog posts and tutorials
    Answering questions on Kaggle, Quora, and other sites
    In-person mentorship and tutoring
    Sharing code examples (in Kaggle Kernels and on GitHub)
    Teaching a class
    Writing a book
```
thoughts:
    
    1. machine learning is really a big task, with a lot small subjects. so it is impossible and useless to learn all the subjects. but you can get a sense of some methods they use leveraging on the features of the dataset. so be project based and target based when learning. AND try to conclude your experience systematically.
    
    2. can try to learn machine learning with the method recommended up there. and after that can try to open some companies using machine learning.
