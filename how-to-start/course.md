click [here](https://github.com/Emrys-Hong/machine_learning/tree/master/coursera/machine_learning_Ng) for more advice:
This course is know as the bible of machine learning. Andrew Ng's classic systematic way covering machine learning models such as regression and vinilla neural networks; This course can teach you a good sense of how math is applied in machine learning. the whole system is applied in matlab. It is good for beginners, but if you want you can watch his deep learning course listed below. There isn't a very big connection between these two courses.


This is an insteresting math series can rise your interest in math and fill in the gaps between machine learning.

### Deep Learning Courses
- [Intro to DeepLearning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOppzHpvTiQ&list=PL2-dafEMk2A7YdKv4XfKpfbTH5z6rEEj3) by Siraj Raval:

Learning deep learning basic concepts like word2vec is useful before touching those overwhelming formulas.

Comments:

This is one of the most classic entry course for deep learning. The assignments are in keras, so you can familarize yourself with with keras library. The course emphasize on the theory's behind deeplearning, but at the same time each assignment gives a individual project using what you have learned each week; The course will also introduce to a lot of papers, which is good for research.
The course covers, basic machine learning models; strategies in deep learning(e.g. overtraining vs overfitting); how to structure your deep learning project; computer vision(classification, object detection); NLP(RNNs, and attetion models).

[useful commands for coders](http://forums.fast.ai/t/wiki-thread-intro-workshop/6537):

Comments: This course brings state-of-art deep learning models and results, the course is taught in jupyter notebook and uses deep learning library pytorch. The courses are extremely project based(uses top down teaching apporach) and are especially useful for kaggle competition; explains the intuitions behind each algorithm quite well; The tutorial is extensively coding with python, numpy and pandas, thus can learn a lot on data analyses using python;

looking at the their [forums](https://forums.fast.ai/) and [website](www.fast.ai) will also gain news/ trends on deep learning; advices on learning machine learning; or life as a machine learning practioner/ data scientist
